# Plan for Enhancing Frontend Test Coverage

To ensure the **Fusion Manaba** storefront is robust, reliable, and maintainable, we can expand our testing strategy in several key areas. This plan outlines a roadmap for increasing test coverage, depth, and improving our overall testing infrastructure.

## 1. Increasing Test Coverage

### Test Untested Files

* **`src/main.tsx`**: The application's entry point is currently untested. We could add tests to ensure that the main router is configured correctly and that the application renders without crashing.
* **`src/services/apiService.ts`**: We can test the API service directly. This would involve verifying that it makes the correct API calls and handles both successful responses and network errors gracefully.

### Cover More Scenarios (Edge Cases)

* **Empty and Error States**: For components that fetch data, we can test how they behave when the API returns no data or an error. For example, the `ProductListPage` should display a "No products found" message if the API returns an empty array.
* **User Input Validation**: For any forms or input fields that might be added in the future, we can write tests to ensure that user input is validated correctly.
* **Permissions and Authentication**: If the application were to have user accounts, we could test how the UI behaves for logged-in versus logged-out users.

## 2. Improving Test Depth and Realism

### Integration Testing

* We can write tests that verify the interactions between components. For example, we could simulate a user adding an item to the cart and then check that the cart in the Navbar updates accordingly. This ensures that the different parts of the application are working together correctly.

#### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

* We could introduce a framework like **Cypress** or **Playwright** to write tests that simulate a full user journey from start to finish. An E2E test could open a real browser, navigate to the application, add items to the cart, and even fill out a checkout form. This is the highest level of testing and provides the most confidence that the application is working as expected.

#### Visual Regression Testing

* We could use a tool like **Percy** or **Storybook** to take snapshots of our components and compare them over time. This helps catch unintended visual bugs that might be introduced when making changes to the UI.

## 3. Enhancing the Test Infrastructure

### Accessibility Testing

* We can integrate an automated accessibility checker like **`axe-core`** into our existing test suite. This would automatically scan our components for common accessibility issues and fail any tests that introduce new violations.

#### Code Coverage Reports

* We can configure our test runner (**Vitest**) to generate a code coverage report. This would show us exactly which parts of our code are being tested and which are not, helping us to identify areas where we need to add more tests.

### Mock Service Worker (MSW)

* Instead of manually mocking our API functions in every test, we could use a library like **MSW** to intercept network requests at the network level. This would make our tests more robust and realistic, as they would be testing the actual network communication of our application.
